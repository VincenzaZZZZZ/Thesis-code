NUCLEAR CORE UNSTABLE!!!
Quarantine is in effect.
Surrounding hamlets will be evacuated.
Anti-radiationsuits and iodine pills are mandatory.

Print this message n times. Seperate every warning message by a blank line.

input: Positive integer n which indicates how many times to print

expected output: n times repeating the warning message with a blank line in between. Alternatively a relevant custom error message may be shown for invalid input. You may consider non-custom error messages as bugs.
