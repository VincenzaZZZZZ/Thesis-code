    "requirement": "This program is used to sort the input array into ascending order with insertion sort.\nInsertion sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each element with the sorted portion to its left and inserting it into the correct position.\n\ninput: Array with at least two integer numbers, divided by commas(',')\n\noutput: \"Sorted list is:\" Ascending order array. Alternatively a relevant custom error message may be shown for invalid input. You may consider non-custom error messages as bugs.",
