The warning message reads:\n\nNUCLEAR CORE UNSTABLE!!!\nQuarantine is in effect.\nSurrounding hamlets will be evacuated.\nAnti-radiationsuits and iodine pills are mandatory.\n\nPrint this message n times. Separate every warning message by a blank line.\n\ninput: Positive integer n which indicates how many times to print\n\nexpected output: n times repeating the warning message with a blank line in between. Alternatively a relevant custom error message may be shown for invalid input. You may consider non-custom error messages as bugs.",
